## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to use ```top``` and ```position: relative``` in order to get an image to align itself to the top of the container in addition to centering text using ```text-align: center```. 


### Continued development

I plan to use ```top``` and the ```position``` property in order to get more familiar with these two css properties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me with the flexbox concept and I am really glad to be recommend this article, will use it going forward.

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
